<+s>This project was extremely fast and easy. I was easily able make the programs and fill out both worksheets. I used the ratio from the CIA fact book, which was easy to analyze.
 
<+--s> There weren't that many negatives. On the PopulationRatio class, I omitted the printing of the random number. The class will only print the result (male or female) caused by the random number (but the random number used will not be printed), because I didn't think printing the random number was necessary. 
******************************************************************************************
In the future: I will continue to use the random method and while loops.
