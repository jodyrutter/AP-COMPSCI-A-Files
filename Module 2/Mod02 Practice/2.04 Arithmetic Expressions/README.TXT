<+s> This project was easy. I was able to build on my previous binary knowledge to learn hexidecimals and octal literals.
     I also found a better way to calculate binary besides using an algorithm in my head of shifting the 1's left, adding 1.
     Now I can calculate binary using exponents.

<-s> I made a few mistakes with syntax as I was working, but I have fixed them.

******************************************************************************************
In the future: I should learn to check my work so that I can avoid making mistakes.
I might be able to fix the mistakes after compiling, but I don't want to make many mistakes on the AP exam.
Practice makes perfect.
