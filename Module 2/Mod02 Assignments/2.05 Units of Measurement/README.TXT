<+s> This project was mostly easy. 
     I looked up a couple conversion factors and most conversions were easy to make.
     I didn't have to look up Celsius or Farenheit because I already new the conversion factors between them.
     

<-s> The Celsius and Farenheit conversion took me more time to program than any others conversions.
     Celsius and Farenheit were harder mainly because of the 3rd variable I had to add.
     The other conversions didn't deal with a 3rd variable at all.
     The third variable in C and F temperature conversions is 32 (the freezing point of water).

******************************************************************************************
In the future: I will get better at writing multi-step conversions.
I would like to learn if there are any ways to make the program account for significant figures in conversions.
I will get better at my ability to write multi-step conversions incase any questions like that exist on the AP Exam.
