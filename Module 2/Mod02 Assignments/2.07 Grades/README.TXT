<+s> This project was estremely easy. 
     This project took very little time and was completed within very few minutes.
     This project could be completed easily by copying the formating I gave to 1 test, pasting that test, and modifying the variables.
     The process came somewhat natural for me.
     

<-s> This project was so easy that I only had to type a few lines. By only typing a few lines, I lost some repetition that I could use to strengthen memory retention of the process.
     

******************************************************************************************
In the future: I will strengthen my memory retention on processes.
