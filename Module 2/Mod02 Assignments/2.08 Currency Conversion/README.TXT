<+s> This project was extremely easy. 
     This project was easily completed by going to bankofamerica.com and using the currency converter to establish a baseline of $1 U.S.D to x(¥/€/₱) Japanese/French/Mexican currency.
     I used the bankofamerica.com currency calculator to verify my results.

<-s> I was somewhat confused on whether I should have converted the double on the "Funds remaining" line of item 1 to an int.
     I kept it as a double because Item 2 "Funds remaining" was a double. If I switched Item 1 "Funds remaining" to a double, it would match the picture, but it still wouldn't give a decimal number like item 2 gives.
     Also, If I switched Item 1 "Funds remaining" to an integer, then if another value was put in, the line would no longer be correct.

In the future:  I will continue to write programs that can be easily understood.
