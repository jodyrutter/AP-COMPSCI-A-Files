<+s> This project was somewhat easy after I thought about what I was going to draw. The lessons presiding this project were very informative.

<-s> I got stuck on deciding what to draw. I was originally going to write 二千十五 into my work. 二千十五(ni-sen-jyuu-go) is Japanese for 2015. I was also thinking about writing ジョディ into my work. ジョディ (jodei) is a similar pronunciation of my name written in Japanese Katakana. I settled on doing the yen symbol because I didn't making a large ASCII artwork piece. Also, some of the curves on the Kanji and Katakana syllables are hard to make out of regular characters. The reason I decided to use Japanese text in my project was because I am trying to teach myself Japanese and many of the characters were readily available in memory.

In the future: I will continue my work with string variables and escape sequences.
