<+s> This project was easy for me. I completed the project very quickly. I made many judgements about what variables I should make into scanners. In the end I made the original message on the TextMessageV2 file into a scanner. I also made the pesos, yen, and euros spent variables and the budget1 and budget2 variables into scanners.  I didn't want to make to many items into scanners because it would remove the need for the program. By keeping some variables as non-scanners, the program still has a task to do.

<-s> There weren't that many negatives about the program. I had a couple errors, but I learned from them.

In the future: I will continue to implement the scanner methods in my programs.
