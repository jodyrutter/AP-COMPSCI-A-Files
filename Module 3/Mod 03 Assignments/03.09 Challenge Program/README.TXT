<+s>This project was easy to me. The project didn't take me a lot of time. I had very little problems with the project. I easily remembered the content from previous lessons, but I also took some time to review before my DBA and test tomorrow. The project works effectively and the output closely matches expected output suggested by the lesson 03.09 assignment page.

<-s> The project gave me plenty of experience with Scanners and Strings, but didn't work for reviewing indexes. There weren't any needs for string indexes or lengths in the program. I will review those commands tomorrow before the DBA and test.
******************************************************************************************
In the future: I will review for tomorrow's exam and DBA. I will also remember the content for future use and the AP exam.
