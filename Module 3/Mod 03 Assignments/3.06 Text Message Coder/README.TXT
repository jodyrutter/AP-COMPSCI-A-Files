***************************************PMR**********************************************
<+s> This project was extremely easy for me. I completed the project fast while still being creative.

<-s> There weren't really any negatives. The compiler rarely complains when I check my work because I am minimizing my errors. Most mistakes are easily diagnosed if I find that the compiler complains.
******************************************************************************************
In the future: I will continue my work with the usage of string methods. I will also get more used to the code and eliminate syntax errors.
