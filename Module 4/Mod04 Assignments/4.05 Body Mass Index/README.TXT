<+s>This project was fast and easy for me. This project was also kind of fun to test out. Most of the info was easily typed. I also learned how to use the Math.pow(a,b) statement. The BMI formula requires the ability to square height in meters. I could have just wrote height in meters times height in meters, but I choose to search for a better way. HeightM^2 didn't work, so I found a better way on Google. Math.pow(a,b) means a^b. I implemented this new formula into my project.
 
<-s> My output my differ a little because I used a different conversion from Google to translate feet and inches to meters. Otherwise, my output should be accurate. I used a Google supplied base conversion factor to translate between units.

In the future: I will continue to use if-else-if statements in my programs.
