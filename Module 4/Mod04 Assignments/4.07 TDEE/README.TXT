<+s>This project was extremely fast and easy. I was also able to finish both tests in the eIMACS textbook. On test #6 I got 100%. I got to use &&. I also made a menu option to exit program.
 
<-s> On test #4, I didn't do as well as on test #6. I might need to do more review on De Morgan's Law, otherwise the other questions were easy. 
I didn't get to use ||(or) in my program.

In the future: I will review De Morgan's Law.
