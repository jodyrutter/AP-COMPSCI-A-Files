<+s>This project was somewhat easy for me. This project also helped me become familiar with booleans and use them to make conditional statements.  

<-s> I didn't have that many negatives. The hardest part of making this program was deciding what I was calculating. After that, the programming came naturally.
******************************************************************************************
In the future: Make further use of booleans and conditional statements.
